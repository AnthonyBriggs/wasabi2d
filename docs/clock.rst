The Clock
=========

Often when writing a game, you will want to schedule some game event to occur
at a later time. For example, we may want a big boss alien to appear after 60
seconds. Or perhaps a power-up will appear every 20 seconds.

More subtle are the situations when you want to delay some action for a shorter
period. For example you might have a laser weapon that takes 1 second to charge
up.

We can use the ``clock`` object to schedule a function to happen in the
future.

Let's start by defining a function ``fire_laser`` that we want to run in the
future::

    def fire_laser():
        lasers.append(player.pos)

Then when the fire button is pressed, we will ask the ``clock`` to call it for
us after exactly 1 second::

    def on_mouse_down():
        clock.schedule(fire_laser, 1.0)

Note that ``fire_laser`` is the function itself; without parentheses, it is
not being called here! The clock will call it for us.

(It is a good habit to write out times in seconds with a decimal point, like
``1.0``. This makes it more obvious when you are reading it back, that you are
referring to a time value and not a count of things.)

``clock`` provides the following useful methods:

.. class:: Clock

    .. method:: schedule(callback, delay)

        Schedule `callback` to be called after the given delay.

        Repeated calls will schedule the callback repeatedly.

        :param callback: A callable that takes no arguments.
        :param delay: The delay, in seconds, before the function should be
                      called.

    .. method:: schedule_unique(callback, delay)

        Schedule `callback` to be called once after the given delay.

        If `callback` was already scheduled, cancel and reschedule it. This
        applies also if it was scheduled multiple times: after calling
        ``schedule_unique``, it will be scheduled exactly once.

        :param callback: A callable that takes no arguments.
        :param delay: The delay, in seconds, before the function should be
                      called.

    .. method:: schedule_interval(callback, interval)

        Schedule `callback` to be called repeatedly.

        :param callback: A callable that takes no arguments.
        :param interval: The interval in seconds between calls to `callback`.

    .. method:: each_tick(callback)

        Schedule `callback` to be called every tick. The callback in this case
        is required to accept a parameter `dt` which is the time in seconds
        since the last tick.

        :param callback: A one argument callable.

    .. method:: unschedule(callback)

        Unschedule callback if it has been previously scheduled (either because
        it has been scheduled with ``schedule()`` and has not yet been called,
        or because it has been scheduled to repeat with
        ``schedule_interval()`` or ``each_tick()``.


Note that the wasabi2d clock only holds weak references to each callback
you give it. It will not fire scheduled events if the objects and methods are
not referenced elsewhere. This can help prevent the clock keeping objects
alive and continuing to fire unexpectedly after they are otherwise dead.

The downside to the weak references is that you won't be able to schedule
lambdas or any other object that has been created purely to be scheduled. You
will have to keep a reference to the object.
